Unit tests
- Should be fast
- Should only test very specific part of code
- Should use mocking 
- Should be easy to understand when they are not working 
- I prefer to have a 1-to-1 correspondance between code base and tests
- Take time to get accustomed to write testable code
-- Small methods
-- Very limited responsibility
- Can serve to explain how the code is intended to work
- Try to use the When, Then, Expect structure to make the tests more readable


Integration tests
- Large code parts play together
- Often difficult to understand when they are not working


GUI tests
- Qt
- Able to start up
- Compare screen shots
- Toggle through pages


Test should be a part of PR
