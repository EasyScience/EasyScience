        Run Bayesian MCMC sampling using the BUMPS DREAM sampler.

        Builds a BUMPS ``FitProblem`` from the bound object and fit
        function and runs the DREAM sampler.  This is the engine-level
        entry point for Bayesian sampling; the public
        :class:`~easyscience.fitting.Sampler` delegates to this method
        after flattening its bound data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : np.ndarray
            Flattened independent variable array.
        y : np.ndarray
            Flattened dependent variable array.
        weights : np.ndarray
            Flattened weight array. Sampling has no default weighting,
            so weights are required; ``Sampler`` enforces this at
            construction.
        samples : int, default=10000
            Number of raw samples to draw across all chains, before thinning.
            A guaranteed minimum, not an exact count: DREAM advances in
            blocks of 10 generations (one generation = one draw per chain)
            and stops at the first block boundary at or past ``samples``.
        burn : int, default=2000
            Burn-in generations to discard. BUMPS counts ``burn`` in
            generations while ``samples`` counts raw draws, so ``burn=500``
            discards ``500 * n_chains`` raw samples.
        thin : int, default=10
            Thinning interval: only every ``thin``-th generation is stored.
        population : int | None, default=None
            BUMPS DREAM population count per parameter (number of parallel
            chains): BUMPS creates ``ceil(population * n_parameters)`` chains.
        resume_state : MCMCDraw | None, default=None
            A BUMPS ``MCMCDraw`` state object from a previous ``run()``
            call. When provided, DREAM **continues** the saved chain
            instead of starting cold.  The population, parameter count,
            and parameter names must match the current model. Otherwise, a
            ``ValueError`` is raised.

            ``samples`` must be the **total** number of raw samples, not an
            increment: to extend an existing chain of ``N`` raw samples by
            ``M``, pass ``samples=N + M`` (DREAM keeps only the last
            ``samples`` draws in its buffer). The `Sampler.extend` helper
            computes this for you.

            ``burn`` is forced to 0 on resume: a previously-converged chain is
            never re-burned.

            The ``population`` and ``initializer`` parameters
            have **no effect** when ``resume_state`` is provided. They
            are determined by the saved state.

            Resuming against *different* data is undefined behaviour (the
            chain's likelihood changes underneath it).
        sampler_kwargs : dict | None, default=None
            Additional keyword arguments forwarded to
            ``bumps.fitters.fit``.
        progress_callback : Callable[[dict], None] | None, default=None
            Optional callback for progress updates during sampling.  The
            payload dict includes ``iteration`` (DREAM generation
            number) and ``sampling: True``. Any return value is ignored.
        abort_test : Callable[[], bool] | None, default=None
            Optional callback that returns ``True`` to signal that
            sampling should be aborted. Called periodically during the
            DREAM sampling loop.

        Returns
        -------
        dict
            Dictionary with keys ``'draws'``, ``'param_names'``,
            ``'internal_bumps_object'``, and ``'logp'``.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the input shapes or weights are invalid, if
            ``progress_callback`` is not callable, or if ``resume_state``
            is incompatible with the current model (parameter count,
            names/order, or population mismatch).
        FitError
            If DREAM sampling was aborted by the user (via
            ``abort_test``).
        Exception
            Re-raised from DREAM fitting if any unexpected error occurs
            (parameter values are restored beforehand).
